🌀 duratii
The Tethered Orchestrator.
"A persistent, real-time companion that wraps around your AI engine."

Duratii is the mobile-first orchestration layer for your development ecosystem. It acts as the "nervous system" for the heavy lifting done by claudecodeui, providing a persistent, bi-directional interface that travels with you.

Like Tillandsia duratii—which is famous for growing "prehensile" leaves that curl around branches to secure a position—this tool uses persistent connections to wrap around your compute instances, allowing you to manage complex AI workflows from a simple mobile interface.

The Anatomy
🔗 Persistent Tendrils (WebSockets) Forget stateless requests. Duratii maintains active, bi-directional WebSocket connections to your claudecodeui instances. It creates a "live wire" between your mobile device and your dev environment, streaming output and capturing input in real-time.

🏗️ Epiphytic Structure It does not try to be the IDE. It relies on siteboon/claudecodeui for the heavy lifting and code execution. Duratii is simply the lightweight, adaptive layer that floats above it, translating that raw power into a mobile-friendly orchestration experience.

📱 The Companion View Designed for the developer who is moving. Whether you are walking the dog or in transit, Duratii keeps the context of your AI sessions alive, allowing you to guide the generation process without being tethered to a desktop.
